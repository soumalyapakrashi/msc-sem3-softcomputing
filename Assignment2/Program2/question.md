# Program 2

Create a class `Clerk` with attributes:
* clrk id
* clrk name
* clrk role
* clrk salary

In the same class, define method `increment_salary()` which takes number as argument. Here _number_ represents the percentage by which the salary should be incremented.

Create another class `Organization` with attributes `org_name` and list of clerk objects.

In the same class, create a method `calculate_salary()` which takes string and number as the input arguments. _string_ input represents the clerk role and _number_ represents the percentage by which the salary should be incremented. Return list of clerk objects whose salary has been incremented.

Note: Use `increment_salary()` method in this method.
